Android Coding task 
=====================================

Introduction
-------------------------------------
This app is given as a task to show car list in Map and  List.

Requirements with comments in line :
● The minimum SDK supported for this application is API 21.
● The app is written strictly in Kotlin programming language.
● Added test cases.
● Error handlling.

● There are 2 sections. MAP, Car list.
● Map screen showing all car markers  and click on markers showing Car details in bottom sheets , Car list screen showing all cars as a list.
● All the data is loaded from the provided API calls.
● Images are cached efficiently.
● API Requests/data loading and showing is done in a way to give the user the best experience.
    Kept in mind the JSON provided might have some data missing in some instances, 
    so these cases are handled gracefully to provide a good UX
● Responsive to all phone sizes.
● Used version control system (Git)

## Implemented things
view desgin is using via `Jetpack compose`
Repository is written in `Kotlin` and is based on `MVVM(ViewModel, LiveData)`
Dependency Injection is implemented using `Koin`
SOLID design principles are followed religiously - The Project is separated in app(presentation), domain and data layers

## Unit Testing

 Unit testing is achieved with `Junit`, `Mockito` and `MockWebServer`
